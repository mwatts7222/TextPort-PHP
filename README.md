TextPort-PHP
============

Examples of how to consume the magical TextPort API with PHP 

TextPort currently offer three methods for consuming their API. They are:

1. Ping 
2. VerifyAuthentication
3. SendMessages

Each of these examples have been included in the file textPortConsume.php. All you will need to do is access the response
that is returned (obj) to validate that everything went through ok. Oh and change the values in the arrays. :-)
